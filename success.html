          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Success Story - Tyree</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Tyree is a sixth grade African American boy. His mother is raising him in a low-income, single parent home. He is </span>
            <span>the middle child of three brothers, and has only met his father a couple of times. He knows that his father used </span>
            <span>drugs and drank often, and Tyree thinks it is better that his father is not part of his life. The lack of a strong father </span>
            <span>influence has been proven to contribute to crime and juvenile delinquency, deteriorating educational achievement, </span>
            <span>depression, substance abuse, and alienation among youth. Initially, Tyree was no exception to these facts, because </span>
            <span>he was often suspended from school and the Learning Center for his disruptive behavior. He struggled with anger </span>
            <span>and a lack of self-control and would throw tables and chairs when he became angry.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>We recognized that Tyree was an intelligent child, but his angry behavior was a hindrance to his success at school </span>
            <span>and at the Learning Center. When asked about his future goals, he expressed a strong interest in music, particularly </span>
            <span>a desire to be a drummer. His love for music led the Learning Center staff to match him with a mentor who played </span>
            <span>the drums. His mentor began giving Tyree lessons every Saturday, if his behavior had been good for the week. Not </span>
            <span>only did his mentor provide great incentives for improved behavior, but he also became a wonderful role model and </span>
            <span>counselor for Tyree. After a year of Saturday lessons with his mentor, Tyree has become a skilled drummer with a strong interest in using his gifts for the church that he attends every Sunday.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>The depth of Tyree's growth as a person was evident in the comments he made to his Learning Center teacher when </span>
            <span>returning from a Citikidz camp event. While other students were talking about friends they had made, and how </span>
            <span>much fun they had at camp, Tyree sat quietly in thought. He finally revealed what was on his mind when he told his </span>
            <span>teacher, "Mrs. Beth, I have decided, when I grow up, I am going to marry one wife and be a great father to all of </span>
            <span>my kids." This may seem like a trivial thought by a maturing young man; however, when 70% of African American </span>
            <span>babies in the U.S. are born out-of-wedlock and raised fatherless, and when there is not one child out of the 74 that </span>
            <span>currently reside in Delmont being raised in a two-parent home, we come to have more of an appreciation for the </span>
            <span>impact of his comment. When 60% of rapists, 72% of adolescent murderers, and 70% of long-term prison inmates </span>
            <span>come from fatherless homes (MD-based National Fatherhood Initiative), the decision that Tyree made that day can be considered anything but trivial.</span>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Success Story - Jerhmontey</h2>
          <p>
            <span>The book of Proverbs tells us that “a child is known by his actions.” Seven-year-old Jerhmontey’s actions express his </span>
            <span>gentleness, humility and desire to serve others. He has worked hard to become a role model for his peers, but the journey has been difficult.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>As a five-year-old, Jerhmontey was known for his violent temper and disrespect for authority. His aggressive </span>
            <span>behavior led to suspension from kindergarten. When he joined Youth Life’s Learning Center in Delmont Plaza, his </span>
            <span>actions continued to draw correction and discipline. But God had big plans for this frustrated little boy.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>As one Youth Life teacher put it, “Kids spell love T-I-M-E.” Day in and day out Jerhmontey spent hours with adult </span>
            <span>teachers and mentors who believed in his future. Somewhere along the way, he began to change. Between </span>
            <span>moments of frustration and disrespect came laughter and confidence. As a first grader, he began to bring home </span>
            <span>awards for honor roll and good citizenship. And by the end of the school year, Jerhmontey was recognized with the </span>
            <span>highest honor at Glen Lea Elementary, the Spirit of the Lion.</span>

          <p>
            <span>The Youth Life Foundation of Richmond is re-writing the future for dozens of high-risk kids like Tyree and </span>
            <span>Jerhmontey. To the untrained eye, the Learning Centers may appear to offer “just” an after-school program. But if </span>
            <span>you look closer, you will see hundreds of mentors investing time and compassion into the lives of these young </span>
            <span>people. You will see characters being built on the foundation of God’s Word. Youth Life kids are exposed to a world </span>
            <span>of opportunity outside of their immediate communities. They are encouraged to dream, some for the first time in their young lives.</span>
