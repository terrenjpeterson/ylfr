          <p>
            <span>The Youth Life Foundation of Richmond was founded in August 2002, and in 2003 became an affiliate of the Darrell Green </span>
            <span>Youth Life Foundation (DGYLF), a proven education and leadership development program started by former Washington Redskin football player Darrell Green.</span></p>
          <p>
            <span>The first Youth Life Foundation of Richmond Learning Center began operating in the Delmont Plaza Apartments, a government-subsidized community in eastern Henrico County, in July 2003.</span>
          </p>
          <img class="featurette-image img-responsive" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ylfr/kids_group_photo.jpg" alt="Group Photo">
          <p>
            <span>Heather Goodlett, the founder was a Title One Reading teacher at Glen Lea Elementary School.  She desired to develop a program that could make a long-term </span>
            <span>commitment to help the children and their families, and ultimately rebuild their community.  With the help of the owners of Delmont Plaza Apartments </span>
            <span>and numerous private donors, this vision became a reality.  We currently serve almost 30 children living in the Delmont Apartments and recently opened </span>
            <span>our newest Learning Center in Highland Park in September 2008.  Currently, this newest Learning Center serves 14 youths from this at-risk Northside community </span>
            <span>and our immediate goal is to double the number of children served within our first two years.</span>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Where We Serve</h2>
          <p>
            <span>Currently, we serve almost 45 students living in the Delmont and Highland Park communities with ages ranging from kindergarten through ninth grade. All of the </span>
            <span>children are African-American and 95% live in single-mother households while 100% of the families are classified as "low income" by government standards. In </span>
            <span>Delmont, the average income level is below $8,200 per year. The majority of the Learning Center students attend Glen Lea Elementary School, one of the lowest </span>
            <span>academic performing schools in the Richmond Metropolitan area, and Overby-Sheppard Elementary School. Both communities have been identified as "hot </span>
            <span>spots" for gangs and drug-related activity.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Surrounded by crime, violence, poverty, and neglect, the children living in these communities are considered an at-risk population. We have come to know each </span>
            <span>childâ€™s individual circumstances well and observe that while they possess tremendous natural intelligence and gifts, they lack the social and academic </span>
            <span>skills that are critical for success as independent adults. Additionally, the strong parental support and involvement experienced by children in other communities </span>
            <span>does not always exist for these children, leaving them unmotivated to set goals and work towards their dreams. YLFR addresses these overarching issues by making a long-term commitment to the </span>
            <span>children and their families to nurture skills and behaviors that positively impact their future. Our after-school model aims to treat the children as individuals to help them overcome obstacles, succeed in life, and become leaders in changing their communities.</span>

          <p>
            <span>On September 8,2008, we opened our second Learning Center program in Highland Park. The new Center is located at 3076 Meadowbridge Road in the Northside of Richmond City. The opening of this Center has been a collaborative </span>
            <span>effort with the Northside Outreach Center. Butch Johnson, the Executive Director of NOC, grew up in Highland Park and has strong ties to the community there. All of our current students come from Overby-Sheppard Elementary, </span>
            <span>where 85% of the students are eligible for the federal school lunch program. With a growing waiting list of students, our immediate goal is to expand this facility to double the number of students served.</span>
