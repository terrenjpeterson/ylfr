            <span>Calvin is one of our oldest students to join the new Learning Center.  Since the beginning of the summer, Calvin was closely following the progress of the center </span>
            <span>coming together and was highly anticipating its opening!  Now that the program has started, we asked Calvin to share a bit about himself and why he was looking </span>
            <span>forward to joining the Youth Life program.</span><br>
            <span></span><br>
            <span>Calvin, a fan of chocolate chip ice cream and pizza, is in the 5th grade at J.E.B. Stuart Elementary School.  He admits that when he first heard about Youth Life, </span>
            <span>he just knew that it sounded fun, but didn't know anything else about it.  He was excited about the ideas of the Fun Friday trips and the Mystery Trip!  </span>
            <span>Now that Calvin is in the program, he has quickly become a leader among his peers.  Without hesitancy, he follows the Learning Center rules and helps look </span>
            <span>out for the younger students.  Although he did not know a number of the students, Calvin began joking with them on the bus and playing football </span>
            <span>with them at recess on the first day.  He is beginning to see that the Learning Center cound benefit him to reach his future goal as a basketball player, </span>
            <span>by "teaching me how to focus."</span><br>
